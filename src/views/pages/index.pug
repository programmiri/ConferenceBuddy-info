      p Hi, I am #[a(class="textlink" href="http://www.programmiri.de") Mirjam] and I am creating #[strong Conference Buddy] for you and me.
      p The idea was born for a simple reason: While I #[strong love] going to meetups, barcamps and conferences, I don't like going on my own when I don't know anyone. Even the thought is #[strong intimidating]. And I can't be the only one, right?
      p Feel free to just drop me a message if you have any feedback about Conference Buddy!
